## State of the Project

At the start of this month, we locked down our Discord and made the project unavailable. We know this was a rather sudden decision. This was an action taken pre-emptively so that we can ensure that every aspect of this project is being done in adherence with fair use guidelines.

Recently, we've been speaking with experts who have performed an audit of our current development process. They have recommended some changes that we make in order to protect the integrity of this project.

We believe that once these guidelines are in place, we will be ready to re-open the project to the public without any further issue. Stay tuned.
