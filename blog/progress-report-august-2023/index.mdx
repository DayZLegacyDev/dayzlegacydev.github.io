## Highlights

### Trader overhaul 
We've pushed a bunch of bug fixes to traders and safezones, and what better way to test them out with an overhauled safe zone?

The new safezone is located near Solnichiny (marked on your map!) and features a new trader layout. We've modified the safezone event handler to be more robust and reliable, so you should no longer see issues with the safezone not being active when it should be. We've also stopped zombies and AI from being able to enter the safezone, so you should be safe from them while you're there. They despawn so you won't see them hanging around the edges of the safezone.

We've fixed several weird issues with the way traders behave, including their clothing and positions, so you should see a much more consistent experience when interacting with them.

This set of fixes also includes a complete rework of the trader price list, so you'll see a lot more items available for purchase, and at prices that are more in line with our economy. We're still working on the "Sell" trader functionality, so for now, you can only buy items from the trader.

### Aimspace improvements 
We continue to work on improving the experience for the "gunner" position in vehicles.

The character will now stay in a seated position while attached to the UH-1H helicopter. We modified their position to feel a little more realistic as well.

We're working on some issues with this system where aiming feels slow/jittery and will hopefully have this nailed down soon.
