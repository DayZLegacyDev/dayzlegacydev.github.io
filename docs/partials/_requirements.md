These are the minimum requirements for DayZ Legacy at the time of writing:

- An operating system that we support
  - Windows 10 / 11
  - If you're using Wine, we will only answer support requests on Ubuntu/an LTS kernel
  - The game **may** work on Windows 8.1/7/Vista, but we will not support these clients. 
- x86-64 dual-core CPU with **SSE** support
  - Most, if not all, 64-bit CPUs should work. DayZ Legacy has a very large CPU footprint, so while this is the minimum requirement to get into game, you will notice stutters and performance issues on weaker CPUs. 
- Graphics card that supports **Shader Model 3** and has **512MB VRAM** at the very least.
  - If you have an AMD Radeon card, updating your AMD drivers to at least version **22.7.1** is recommended. Older driver versions or other AMD cards will be running at a disadvantage.
  - Anything older than a **700-series** NVIDIA GPU will experience significant performance issues. 
  - Integrated graphics cards such as **Intel HD 3000** are not supported and we will not provide support for these hardware configurations. 
- At least 2 GiB of available RAM for the game is required, but **8GiB or more is highly recommended**. 
- You **will** experience much slower loads with a hard drive compared to an SSD.
